## Practice Github Actions

To practice the functionality of Github Actions, you need to write a short code.  
I've written a short code that crawls HTML of 'Naver'.

You can create Github Workflow in the './.github/workflows'.  
The current location is where the main code is located.

### What you have to do
1. fork my repo
2. clone the repo in your local machine.

3. go to Settings in your account
4. navigate to Personal Access Token (PAT) -> Token (classic)
5. generate new token -> Token (classic)
6. copy the created token

7. go to 'Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions' in your repo
8. create 'new repository secrets'
9. enter 'myToken' in [Name] and the copied token in [Secret] => it'll be a variable you can use in your repo! 

10. go to Actions in your repo
11. Run your workflow file ! you're not an expert in Github Actions! lol

## BTW What is the Github Actions?
